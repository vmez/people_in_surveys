Kaggle conducts annual [surveys](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017) to its users to gather data on what the current role of the Data Scientist is and incentivise others to analyse that data and share their findings. Some have used [inforgraphics](https://www.cloudfactory.com/hubfs/02-Contents/5-Infographics/Life-of-Data-Scientist-Infographic.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4ed5fb6f-cb6d-4b5f-971e-3f69697204c2%7C77b4ec9b-262d-4ae4-bab3-8ac3be56a4f8) that are widely shared and discussed to help others understand this role in our society today.


This repository is focused to uncover the stories of the participants from the [latest](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018#multipleChoiceResponses.csv) survey Kaggle conducted in October 2018 since it captured responses from 23,859 participants - a 45% increase from the last.

I am not interested in averages.

Who are these people?
