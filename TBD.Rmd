### Intro

This is Part 2 of the series People in Surveys.

I am analysing data from a [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018#multipleChoiceResponses.csv) conducted by Kaggle in October 2018, gathering data on the state of Machine Learning and Data Science as viewed from their subscribers.
